=head1 NAME

cellcc_retry-job - Retry a permanently-failed CellCC sync job

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<cellcc retry-job> <I<jobid>>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<cellcc retry-job> command allows CellCC to retry a sync job that has
permanently failed (because it has generated too many errors).

After a stage in a CellCC sync job fails, the CellCC check-server will normally
try to resume the sync job, starting from the last successful stage. If this
happens too many times in the same job, though (specified by the
B<check/error-limit> configuration directive), the job will be "permanently"
failed, and will not be retried automatically.

Typically, this situation means there is something wrong in the environment,
with OpenAFS, or CellCC, or in any case the situation must be fixed by an
administrator. An administrator should examine what has gone wrong in such a
situation, and try to fix it. Once the problem has been identified and fixed,
an administrator should run the B<cellcc retry-job> command to allow the sync
job to proceed again.

The <I<jobid>> given to this command can be retrieved from either the
B<cellcc jobs> command, or an alert generated by one of the B<check/alert-*>
configuration directives.

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer of this command must be able to read the "admin" CellCC
configuration, typically in B</etc/cellcc/cellcc_admin.json>, which allows
write operations to the CellCC system. Typically this is only allowed for
administrators or accounts dedicated to this "syncing" functionality.
