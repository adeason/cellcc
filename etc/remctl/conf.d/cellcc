# Change cellcc@REALM.EXAMPLE.COM below to the principal specified in the
# 'remctl/princ' directive in your cellcc configuration.
#
# Note that cellcc does its own authorization checks, separately from remctl.
# So you can just specify "ANYUSER" as the last field (instead of
# "princ:foo@BAR"), and let cellcc handle checking the authorization according
# to the cellcc configuration. However, it is more secure to have remctl itself
# check it before the command is run, so that is what is recommended.

# Uncomment the following line to enable remctl access for cellcc.
#cellcc remctl /usr/bin/cellcc princ:cellcc@REALM.EXAMPLE.COM
